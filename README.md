EMC SourceOne PowerShell Module
=========================================
This project contains a Powershell module for managing an EMC SourceOne environment.


Description
=========================================
The SourceOne console (MMC) is the only supported way of configuring and managing a SourceOne implementation.
This PowerShell module provides a means of scripting and automating SourceOne configuration and management function without using the
SourceOne console.

The PowerShell module provides a wrapper around the same COM objects used by the MMC.

This PowerShell module must be run in an x86 (32 bit) instance of PowerShell.  SourceOne's COM objects are all 32 bit objects and only 
registered for use by 32 bit applications.

Installation
