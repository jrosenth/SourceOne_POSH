EMC SourceOne PowerShell Module                           Â [![License](http://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-brightgreen.svg)](LICENSE)=========================================This project contains a Powershell module for managing and automating the configuration of an EMC SourceOne environment.
Requirements========================================  * EMC SourceOne Version 7.1.3 or greater  * PowerShell 4 or greater  * .NET 4 or greater
Description=========================================The EMC SourceOne console (MMC) is the only supported way of configuring and managing a SourceOne implementation.This PowerShell module provides a means of scripting and automating SourceOne configuration and management functions without using theSourceOne console application.
The PowerShell module provides a wrapper around the same .NET and COM objects used by the MMC.
This PowerShell module must be run in an x86 (32 bit) instance of PowerShell.  SourceOne's COM objects are all 32 bit objects and only registered for use by 32 bit applications.
This module also require PowerShell 4.  The underlying COM objects require .NET 4 (or greater) and PowerShell 4 bind to .NET 4 by default.
Usage========================================= * You must be logged in as or run the PowerShell instance with a user that has SourceOne administration privileges. * Some commands may require the shell instance to be launched using "Run as Administator".  This especially applies to commands which   connect to and manage other machines (VMs) within the SourceOne implementation. Commands which manage Windows services use the    "Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)" interfaces and objects.  Managing services generally requires administrator privileges    and accessing machines remotely also requires elevated privileges.  More information about WMI can be found by   googling "wmi and powershell".  
Installation=========================================There are two methods for installing the SourceOne Powershell.
 * Download and execute the Windows based installer (ES1PowerShellInstall.msi) on a machine with SourceOne installed on it.  It is recommended installing on the same machine as the SourceOne console application, but not required.   The installer creates a desktop shortcut, installs the module into the SourceOne binary installation location and adds that location to the system environment variable PSModulePath making the module easily available to any PowerShell instance.   The installer is based on the free and open source <a href="http://wixtoolset.org/"> WIX Toolset </a>
 * Download the contents of the SourceOne_POSH directory and copy it into a directory named "SourceOne_POSH" on a machine with SourceOne installed on it.  Then use the explicit "Import-Module" command to load the module specifying the full path of the directory.
  There are other methods for installing and loading modules in PowerShell.  See <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd878350(v=vs.85).aspx"> Installing a PowerShell Module </a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd878284(v=vs.85).aspx"> Importing a PowerShell Module </a> for more information.
